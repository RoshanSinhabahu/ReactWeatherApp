# 🌦️ React Weather Dashboard

A sleek React weather app that shows **live weather data** with animated backgrounds, a modern glass-style UI, and real-time updates.

## 🧩 AI & Me: The Collaboration

During development, I explored how AI could help with specific needs 😃, mainly using **Google Gemini**, with some help from ChatGPT.  
I adjusted the AI-generated code to fit the project.  
The idea and design are mine, and AI helped speed up development and gave useful guidance.
